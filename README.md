# Star Wars Profile Site

## Directions

In today's project, you'll be asked to write code to make live Ajax requests, and to put the data you retrieve together with HTML and CSS to display it in a meaningful way.

- Start with the mockup below and use the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) to pull in data to build a profile of a character, planet, vehicle, or starship.
- All of the data you display should be coming from the API, with the exception of the photo. A photo is not required, but if you choose to use one, you'll need a local file or an image url as a source.
- The mockup is styled using a [card component](https://tachyons.io/components/#cards) from a CSS library called [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/). You can use this library, another library, or no library. Your page should be styled, but the primary focus of the assignment is to get data from an API and display it on the page using JavaScript.

## Hints

<!-- Since there are no starter files provided, you'll need to create your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and link them together properly. -->

<!-- Before you start writing any JavaScript, we suggest you spend a few moments reading through the [Star Wars API docs](https://swapi.co/documentation) to get familiar with how you can obtain the data. -->

<!-- You can use your browser or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to try out requests to get your data from the API. -->

Once you have a decent grasp on that, start setting up your Ajax calls and your callback functions to work with the data you retrieve.
